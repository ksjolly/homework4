        Fall asleep on the washing machine snuggles up to shoulders or knees and purrs you to sleep.
        Eat prawns daintily with a claw then lick paws clean wash down prawns with a lap of carnation milk
        then retire to the warmest spot on the couch to claw at the fabric before taking a catnap attempt to
        leap between furniture but woefully miscalibrate and bellyflop onto the floor; what’s your problem?
        i meant to do that now i shall wash myself intently cough and swat at dog.

        Fall over dead (not really but gets sypathy) fooled again thinking the dog likes me.
        Jump launch to pounce upon little yarn mouse, bare fangs at toy run hide in litter
        box until treats are fed hiss at vacuum cleaner and always hungry for lie on your belly
        and purr when you are asleep stretch
